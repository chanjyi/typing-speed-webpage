        <div id="box"><h2>Fun fact about keyboard</h2>
            <h3>1. QWERTY keyboard</h3>
             <p>So why keyboard starts with QWERTY and not, for example, ABCDE? QWERTY layout was invented by Christopher Sholes
         in 1872 for his new typewriter design (of course there was no computers these days). It turns out that when you would place keys 
         in alphabetical order, people would type so fast, that the mechanical parts (so called hammers) would jam. Sholes came with the idea 
         that in order to slow people down, you need to mess with the layout.
         QWERTY is also constructed that way to minimize the neighbouring keystrokes - which too - jammed the hammers.</p>
        
        
             <h3>2. The bumps on the F and J keys – have you noticed them?</h3>
             <p>Have you ever noticed that the majority of QWERTY keyboards have a slight bump on the F and J keys? 
             These bumps are made for ease of use for typists. If you place your left-hand index finger on F and right-hand index finger on J,
              then either of your thumbs will rest on the space bar and the remaining three fingers will cover the "A S D" and "K L ;" keys.  
            This helps you to find keys in the dark, or if you are touch typing.</p>
        
        
             <h3>3. What is the longest word on the top row?</h3>
             <p>Typewriter is the longest word that can be made using one row of the keyboard.  T
            he word Typewriter can be typed using only the top row on QWERTY keyboards. Some speculate that QWERTY inventor, 
            Christopher Sholes, did that on purpose as a kind of demonstration back in the 19th century.</p>
        

        
             <h3>4.Longest words with the left and right hand</h3>
             <p>On a QWERTY keyboard, “stewardesses” is the longest 12 letter word that can be typed with the left 
                hand and “polyphony” for the right.</p>
        

        
             <h3>5. Swipe to Type on phone</h3>
             <p>For some people, swiping to type is quicker and more efficient than tapping: You can move your finger across the keyboard, 
                pausing briefly at each character you want to register and only lifting it up when you’re done inputting a word.</p>
